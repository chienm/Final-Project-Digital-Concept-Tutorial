## What is Binary?
 
Binary is a system of counting, with each digit represented by 2 values, either 1 or 0. 

Each increment of a digit increases the weight of a digit by the power of 2.

So this would mean that the first digit from the right would have a value of 2^0, or the value of 1. The second digit from the right would have a value of 2^1 , or the value of 2.

## Example of Binary

The following example is a binary number equal to the value of 83.
