## What are Decimal Value?
 
Decimal Values is a system of counting, with each digit represented by 10 values, from the number 0 to 9. 

Each increment of a digit increases the weight of a digit by the power of 10.

So this would mean that the first digit from the right would have a value of 10^0, or the value of 1. The second digit from the right would have a value of 10^1 , or the value of 10.

## Example of Decimal Values

The following example breaks down the values of the decimal number **1234**.

* The number 1 is the first digit, which has a weight of 10^0. So the value will equal to 1.

* The number 2 is the second digit, which has a weight of 10^1. So the value will equal to 20.

* The number 3 is the second digit, which has a weight of 10^2. So the value will equal to 300.

* The number 4 is the second digit, which has a weight of 10^3. So the value will equal to 4000.
